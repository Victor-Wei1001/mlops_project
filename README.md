# English-to-Chinese Translation Project
**Course 02476 MLOps - Exam Project**

## Project Description

In this project, we want to build a translator that converts **English to Chinese**. We will fine-tune the **T5-small model** using a subset of the **WMT19 English-Chinese dataset**. This dataset is a standard for machine translation tasks.

T5 is a versatile text-to-text model from Huggingface. While it can already handle multiple languages, we aim to specifically fine-tune it for the English-to-Chinese language pair. To achieve this, we will use the **Transformers framework** as our required third-party package, along with **PyTorch Lightning** to keep our training code organized.

Our main focus is on building a solid **MLOps pipeline**. To reach this goal, we will use:
* **Cookiecutter** for a clean and standard project structure.
* **DVC** for handling and versioning our translation data.
* **Docker** for containerizing our code to ensure it runs everywhere.
* **Weights and Biases** to track our experiments and monitor model performance.
